This project provides an API for creating JSON messages suitable for use with the System for Cross-domain Identity Management v. 2 (see simplecloud.info). SCIM is an open API for managing identities which is published under the IETF. The API creates valid SCIM messages, but does not POST those messages, nor does it implement the server-side of the specification.
